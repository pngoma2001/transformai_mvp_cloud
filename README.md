## Evidence Sources (optional)

Upload any of the following CSVs (or tick "Use sample evidence files") to improve recommendations:
- `customer_survey.csv` → columns: respondent_id, nps, price_sensitivity_low, price_sensitivity_high
- `market_prices.csv` → columns: sku, our_price, comp_price, units_share
- `macro.csv` → columns: date, cpi_category, value
- `stockouts.csv` → columns: sku, date, stockout_flag, lead_time_days
- `utilization.csv` → columns: site, date, capacity, filled, no_show_rate

The app computes indices (Pricing Power, Churn Risk, Supply Stress, Utilization Gap), shows them as chips, re‑orders plays, and adjusts default sliders. The PDF includes an Evidence appendix.
